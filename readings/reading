Software Vulnerability
A weakness or flaw in a program that allows attackers to exploit it, access systems, steal data, or cause damage. It usually results from coding mistakes, and fixing vulnerabilities is essential for security.


Source Code Analysis
The process of examining a program’s code—manually or with automated tools—to detect bugs and security issues early. It improves code quality, security, and overall development efficiency.


Python
A popular and easy-to-learn programming language used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation, and building many types of applications. Its powerful libraries make complex tasks easier.


Web Application
A program that runs entirely online through a browser (like Chrome or Safari) without needing to be installed. Examples include social media platforms, online stores, and email services. It is accessible from any device with internet.


Git and GitHub
Git is a version control system that tracks changes in code and allows developers to return to previous versions.
GitHub is an online platform that hosts Git projects and supports teamwork, collaboration, and code sharing.
Teams use them to stay organized and avoid conflicting changes.
