Git is a system that helps programmers save copies of their code and track every change made to it, allowing them to easily revert to any previous version. GitHub is an online platform that allows users to upload and share Git projects with their team. Teams use both systems to organize their work and avoid lost or conflicting changes between developers. Git makes teamwork more organized and professional. GitHub facilitates collaboration, code review, and the secure storage of projects, accessible from anywhere.
